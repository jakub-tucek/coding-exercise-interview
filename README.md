# Coding exercise interview

## 1. Coding exercise - React

The exercise is to create a simple single page application, that displays tasks that needs to be done - a TODO list.

Your application should have a header that stays visible when user is scrolling the page.

The user will be able to create new TODO item by putting its name in a input and saving it using a button or ‘enter’ key.

All created items should be displayed in the list. Each item can be deleted, if user changes his mind. 

The application should contain some tests (we recommend Jest).

You can use Create React App if you want. You can write app in Javascript or Typescript and use class components or hooks. Feel free to use any library that you need. The application should have some basic styles so it looks nice.

Good luck :)
